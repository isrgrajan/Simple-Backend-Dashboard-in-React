# Simple and Easy React and Font Awesome UI for Backend Design

This is a sample UI created using React and Font Awesome. The UI includes a navbar with a toggleable left-side menu that displays Font Awesome icons. The UI was created using the `reactstrap` library to create the navbar and menu, and the `@fortawesome/react-fontawesome` library to display Font Awesome icons.
